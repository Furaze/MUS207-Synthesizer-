/*
ExplicitWave will be a class for a wave made of waves of specific frequencies
RatioWave will be a class for a wave made of ratios to the fundamental frequency, which can be set at write time

there will be a method to convert an ExplicitWave to a RatioWave

operator overloads for +, so that a BasicWave can be added to a ExplicitWave or RatioWave

Remember to filter out anything above the Nyquist frequency at write time
